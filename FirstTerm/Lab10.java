/********************************************************************************
Name: Ronnie Mohapatra
Period: 8
Name of the Lab: Lab 10
Due Date: October 4, 2017
Date Submitted:
What I Learned: a) You must cast integer math into to doubles to return a double
                b) Relational operators are higher than logical operators
                c) .nextInt() takes can take integers
                d) Order of your if statements matter. for example, if you have the
                   same point logic after the vertical line logic, it will say the 
                   same point is a vertical line.
