/************************************************
Name: Ronnie Mohapatra
Lab:  Card Lab
What I learned: a) The remove method also returns
                   the card that was removed.This
                   makes it easier to set values
                   during shuffle().
                b) You must always implement the
                   ArrayList object before actually
                   adding or removing elements into
                   it.
                c) ArrayList is used for elastic
                   lists unlike 1-D arrays which
                   are held to a certain amount
                   of elements.
