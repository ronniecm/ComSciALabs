/************************************************
Name: Ronnie Mohapatra
Lab:  Card Lab
What I learned: a) You must always implement the
                   ArrayList object before using
                   its methods.
                b) With a for each loop, your
                   iterator type is whatever
                   DATA TYPE that is stored within
                   the array or ArrayList.
                c) Always test your methods before
                   actually applying them into
                   a real application.
